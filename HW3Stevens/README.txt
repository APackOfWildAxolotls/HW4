This is a basic song directory. there are not song files or streaming of any kind. 
It is to get a deeper understanding of hashtables and other java concepts.

the user is supposed to follow the text prompts,
and they can choose to add things like playlists, libraries, and even new songs.

when filling out new songs and playlists the titles and names have to be different. (there is no "same name" prompt)

any y/n prompt must be followed by y/n or it will throw an exception. If demo_songs.txt is moved it will cause the songs to not be uploaded.
multiple songs with the same title conflict and will be overwritten. 

when inspecting the code the run button will start and the place where System.out.print would print to is where the 
user has to put the information.

Concepts: Inheritance, File Reading, loops, some exception handling, and hashtables
